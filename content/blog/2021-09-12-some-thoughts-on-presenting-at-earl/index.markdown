# EARL 2021

Now a few days have passed I wanted to write down some thoughts on having presented at [EARL 2021](https://www.bigmarker.com/series/earl-conference/series_summit) on Friday. 

EARL is my favourite conference. I have learnt so much from the training that is offered and from the talks too. Since I first attended several years ago I have wanted to present, which is quite a thing as I don't get to do too much external presenting as part of my current role.  On Friday I achieved this goal. It felt really good to present alongside so many great speakers on the day. 

I haven't really talked about it much but I was off work for a while over the summer and having this talk as something to aim for mentally was really helpful to me. 

A special thanks to Scott and Luisa for helping me review the slides and for all the feedback.

I hope some of the people who heard my talk took something away from it, and if anyone has any questions about it I am happy to chat about it.

I will stick the slides up here once I get official sign off from work :-)
