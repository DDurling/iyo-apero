I'm a Data Scientist who works at the Bank of England. I wanted to see if I build a website using blogdown, and here are the results. 

I hope this will be a place for me to write regularly on things I like, not just stuff I am working on. So there will be coffee & wrestling blogposts alongside R and Data Science stuff. I am bringing my whole self to this blog.
