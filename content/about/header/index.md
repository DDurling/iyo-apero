<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a Data Scientist who works at the Bank of England. I wanted to see if I could build a website using blogdown. After much effort, it seems I can. 

I hope this will be a place for me to write regularly on things I like, find interesting and think others might benefit from. So there will be coffee & wrestling blogposts alongside R and Data Science stuff. I am bringing my whole self to this blog.
